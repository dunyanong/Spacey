Spacey is a web application built using Next.js, React (with Javascript), Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to vote for their favorite football players (GOAT) and provides a platform for the audience to participate in the voting process. Each user can vote for two players: one as the GOAT and the other as an honorable mention.

The project includes additional features such as a chat functionality and a music feature. The chat feature enables users to communicate with each other, while the music feature enhances the overall user experience by providing a curated playlist.

## Installation

To run Spacey locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spacey.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Spacey`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a Firebase project and set up the necessary configuration files (refer to the Firebase documentation for more details).
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure the Firebase credentials. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Obtain the Firebase configuration object (containing API keys and other credentials).
3. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the project.

Add the following environment variables to the `.env.local` file:

1. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
3. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
4. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
5. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
6. NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id


Make sure to replace `your-firebase-api-key`, `your-firebase-auth-domain`, and other placeholders with your actual Firebase project credentials.
